# Mapping_Earthquakes

Using Leaflet, I was able to create a map with the most recent earthquakes from GeoJSON data provided at the USGS website. Multiple layers were added onto the map so that users can see the magnitudes of the earthquakes, earthquakes greater than 4.5 magnitude and tectonic plates.
